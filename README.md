# Aerial-Cactus-CNN-classification
Using a covolutional neural network to classify the presence of an aerial cactus in the images

This is a kaggle  dataset and it canbe found in the following link

 The accuracy I achieved by using a simple two convolution layered neural network without using the keras image augmentation method was 98.33% on the public leaderboard.
